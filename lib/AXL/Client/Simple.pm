=head1 NAME

EWS::Client - Microsoft Exchange Web Services Client

=head1 VERSION

This document refers to version 0.04 of EWS::Client

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Set up your Exchange Web Services client:

 use EWS::Client;
 use DateTime;
 
 my $ews = EWS::Client->new({
     server      => 'exchangeserver.example.com',
     username    => 'oliver',
     password    => 's3krit', # or set in $ENV{EWS_PASS}
 });

Then perform operations on the Exchange server:

 my $entries = $ews->calendar->retrieve({
     start => DateTime->now(),
     end   => DateTime->now->add( month => 1 ),
 });
 
 print "I retrieved ". $entries->count ." items\n";
 
 while ($entries->has_next) {
     print $entries->next->Subject, "\n";
 }
 
 my $contacts = $ews->contacts->retrieve;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module acts as a client to the Microsoft Exchange Web Services API. From
here you can access calendar and contact entries in a nicely abstracted
fashion. Query results are generally available in an iterator and convenience
methods exist to access the properties of each entry.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 EWS::Client->new( \%arguments )

Instantiates a new EWS client. There won't be any connection to the server
until you call one of the calendar or contacts retrieval methods.

=over 4

=item C<server> => Fully Qualified Domain Name (required)

The host name of the Exchange server to which the module should connect.

=item C<username> => String (required)

The account username under which the module will connect to Exchange. This
value will be URI encoded by the module.

=item C<password> => String OR via C<$ENV{EWS_PASS}> (required)

The password of the account under which the module will connect to Exchange.
This value will be URI encoded by the module. You can also provide the
password via the C<EWS_PASS> environment variable.

=item C<schema_path> => String (optional)

A folder on your file system which contains the WSDL and two further Schema
files (messages, and types) which describe the Exchange 2007 Web Services SOAP
API. They are shipped with this module so your providing this is optional.

=back

=head2 $ews->calendar()

Retrieves the L<EWS::Client::Calendar> object which allows search and
retrieval of calendar entries and their various properties. See that linked
manual page for more details.

=head2 $ews->contacts()

Retrieves the L<EWS::Client::Contacts> object which allows retrieval of
contact entries and their telephone numbers. See that linked manual page for
more details.

=head1 TODO

There is currently no handling of time zone information whatsoever. I'm
waiting for my timezone to shift to UTC+1 in March before working on this, as
I don't really want to read the Exchange API docs. Patches are welcome if you
want to help out.
